## **Content Description**

This lecture focuses on three of the main R data types: vectors, matrices and arrays. These are R data objects with specific properties and with a direct link to algebraic operations. In most cases they will be numerical, but they can also be of character or logical class. All of them are restricted to a single class of elements, i.e. being exclusively numeric or coersed to character if different classes are introduced.

## **VECTORS**
A vector is a simple array (one dimmension) of numbers or characters, such as the measurements of a single variable
A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic class
A vector is defined by its mode and length

We already saw yesterday how the combine function can be used to create vectors.
```{r eval=TRUE}
# a numeric vector
x <- c(20, 50, 100)  
x

# a logical vector
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
x

# a vector of characters
x <- c("GG","TT","GA","AT","CC")
x

```

Note that a vector cannot mix different types of elements. In doing so, numbers are coerced to characters to maintain the same type of elements.
```{r eval=TRUE}
x <- c(2,3,5)
y <- c("a", "b", "c")
z <- c(x,y)
z

class(x)
class(y)
class(z)
```

A vector can be defined by its mode() and its lenght()
```{r eval=FALSE}
mode(x)
length(x)
```

## **CREATING VECTORS**

There are several functions in R for creating specific types of vectors, i.e. by drawing random numbers from a distribution, by repeating elements, or through sequences. 

# **Sequences**

```{r eval=TRUE}
x <- 1:20
x

1:20-1  
1:(20-1)

?seq
seq(from=1, to=20, by=1)
seq(0, 10, 0.1)
seq(length=9, from=1, to=5)
seq(from=1, to=5, length=9)

?sequence
sequence(5)
sequence(3:5)
```

# **Repeat**

```{r eval=TRUE}
?rep
rep(1, 50)
rep(1:4, 2)
rep(1:4, each=2) 
rep(1:4, c(2,4, 5, 3))
rep(1:4, each=2, times=10)
```

This also works with characters, and using other vectors
```{r eval=TRUE}
y <- c("a", "b", "c")
r <- rep(y,3)  
```

# **Random numbers**
We can draw random numbers from an already existing vector. This is very useful for e.g. data suffling during permutation procedures.
```{r eval=TRUE}
?sample
x <- sample(1:5, 5, replace=F)
x
#y <- sample(1:5, 6, replace=F) does not work
y <- sample(1:5, 6, replace=T)
y
duplicated(y)
sample(r, 20, replace = T)
```

We can also draw random numbers from specific statistical distributions.
```{r eval=TRUE}
?runif
x <- runif(10)
x
x <- runif(1000)
hist(x)

x2 <- runif(100, min=0, max=500)
hist(x2)

?rnorm
rnorm(10)
x <- rnorm(100, mean=25, sd=2)  
hist(x)

?rpois
?rexp
?Distributions
```

# **The seed**
**VERY important** for randomized sampling proceedures
The seed is a position in a numbers matrix that R uses to start its algorithms of randomized sampling functions. By setting the seed, we can control the generation of random numbers. This becomes important when e.g. wanting to replicate exactly a randomization experiment or when wanting to make sure that *different* random samples are drawn from a distribution.
```{r eval=TRUE}
??set.seed

rnorm(100)
rnorm(100)

set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100)
x
set.seed(123)
y <- rnorm(100)
y
```

# **Naming vectors**
The elements of a vector can be named. This is useful for data organization and inndexing.
```{r eval=TRUE}
size1 <- c(20, 50, 100, 25 , 5, 20)
size1
country <- c("Portugal", "Spain", "France", "Italy", "Denmark", "Finland")

names(size1) <- country
size1
```

## **OPERATIONS WITH VECTORS**
Operations with vectors are conducted elementwise.
```{r eval=TRUE}
a <- c(10, 30, 50, 70, 25)
5 + a
5 * a
a / 5

b <- seq(5, 25, by=5)
c <- a + b
a
b
c
```

# **Recycling**
When two vectors are of unequal length, the shorter one will be recycled in order to match the longer vector
```{r eval=TRUE}
d <- c(20, 5)
a - d
a * d
```

**VERY IMPORTANT:** READ WARNINGS AND ERRORS!!!
But be careful, because the warning is **only** shown if the vectors are  *fractionally* recycled:
```{r eval=TRUE}
length(a)
length(d)

rep(a, 2) - d
```

# **Comparing vectors**
R uses specific symbology that allows us to compare vectors, again in an elemntwise manner.
```{r eval=TRUE}
size1 <- c(20, 50, 100, 25, 5, 20)
size2 <- c(12, 15, 10, 5, 5, 15)

size1 == size2
size1 > size2
size2 <= size1
size1%in%size2

any(size1 > size2)
all(size1 > size2)
```

## **VECTOR POSITIONS**
Remember: a vector is an object with one dimension.
Elements of the vector can be retrieved based on their (uni-dimensional) position in the vector using straight brackets.
```{r eval=TRUE}
size1[1]
size2[5]
size2[-1]      
```

More on this tommorow, when we discuss indexing.

## **MATRICES**
A matrix is a two-dimensional array (two dimmensions) of values
A matrix is a collection of vectors (e.g. measurements of several variables for the same objects)
A matrix can only contain data of the same type, as is the case for vectors

Let's define three vectors:
V1 containing numbers form 1 to 5
V2 containing numbers form 100 to 108 with a step of 2
V3 containing the number 50 five times
```{r eval=TRUE}
V1 <- c(1:5)
V2 <- seq(100, 108, 2)
V3 <- rep(50, 5)
```

# **Creating matrices**
Two major functions for creating matrices are cbind() and rbind(), which allow us to bind together vectors (or matrices) by columns or by rows.
```{r eval=TRUE}
cbind(V1, V2, V3)
rbind(V1, V2, V3)
```

This works because the three vectors have the same length, but if that were not the case R would apply *recycling* to bind the vectors.
```{r eval=TRUE}
V4 <- 10:16
rbind(V1, V4)
```

Again, be careful, because the warning is shown only if the vectors are  *fractionally* recycled:
```{r eval=TRUE}
V5 <- 1:3
V6 <- 1:6
rbind(V5,V6)
```

Most usually, matrices are created using the **matrix()** function:
```{r eval=TRUE}
matrix(nrow=3, ncol=5)
matrix(0, nrow=3, ncol=5)
matrix(1:15, nrow=3, ncol=5)
matrix(c(1:15), nrow=3)
```

But *careful*, to define a matrix, you need to define its dimensions! If not, a one-column matrix is assumed (which is not the same as a vector).
```{r eval=TRUE}
poo <- matrix(c(1:15))
poo
c(1:15)
```

The argument *byrow* allows us to control in which direction the matrix will be filled.
```{r eval=TRUE}
matrix(1:15, nrow=3, ncol=5, byrow=TRUE)
```

Again, careful with matrix dimensions and treaming or recycling warning messages.
```{r eval=TRUE}
matrix(1:17, nrow=3, ncol=5)
matrix(1:17, nrow=3)
```

## **Naming matrices**
Same as for vectors, the positions of matrices can be named, in this case through row and column names.
```{r eval=TRUE}
mat1 <- rbind(V1,V2,V3)
mat2 <- cbind(V1,V2,V3)

mat1
mat2

rownames(mat1)
rownames(mat2)
colnames(mat2)
dimnames(mat1)

rownames(mat2) <- country[-6]
dimnames(mat2)
mat2
```

## **EXERCISE:**
Create a matrix with 5 rows and 4 columns containing data from an RNA expression experiment.
Create random data to fill it in
Rows are four treatments and columns are number of reads for different genes.
```{r eval=TRUE}
my.exp <- matrix(sample(1:1000,20), nrow=5, ncol=4)
rownames(my.exp) <- paste("Treatment", 1:5, sep="")
colnames(my.exp) <- paste("Gene", 1:4, sep="")
```

# **Matrix positions**
Matrices have two dimensions: rows and columns. As such, their positions are defined based on the coordinates for these two dimensions
```{r eval=TRUE}
dim(mat2)
mat2

mat2[3, 2]
mat2["France", "V2"]
```

# **Operations with matrices**
Also work elementwise
```{r eval=TRUE}
mat1
mat1 + 4
mat1 * 10
# mat1 + mat2 doesn´t work because matrices do not have the same dimensions
```

Matrices can also be transposed:
```{r eval=TRUE}
t(mat2)
mat1 + t(mat2)
```

One can also perform summary operations **by rows or by columns** of a matrix:
```{r eval=TRUE}
colSums(mat1)
rowSums(mat1)
colMeans(mat1)
rowMeans(mat1)
```

A more general function that allows us to do this - and many many other things - is **apply()**. Apply uses the *margin* argument to define if operations are done by rows (margin = 1) or by columns (margin = 2)
```{r eval=TRUE}
apply(mat1, 1, sum)
apply(mat1, 2, sum)
```

Using **apply()** one can apply (pun intended) any function by rows or columns
```{r eval=TRUE}
apply(mat1, 1, max)
apply(mat1, 2, mean)
```

**NOTE:** apply() is member of a family of functions that also includes:
 - tapply() for applying a function to an array by a grouping factor
 - lapply() and sapply() for applying a function to parts of a list (see next lecture)
All these functions are EXTREMELY useful when an operation needs to be repeated across elements of a matrix, array or list. Their use and behaviour is a bit complex to cover in this course, but keep them in mind whenever you are trying to apply a function to specific margins of your data.

## **ARRAYS**
An array is a three-dimensional object (three dimmension) of numbers or characters
An array is a collection of matrices (e.g. measurements of several variables for the same objects, across treatments)
An array can only contain data of the same type
```{r eval=TRUE}
ARR <- array(1:12, dim=c(2,3,2))
ARR

dim(V1)
dim(mat1)
dim(ARR)
```
 
**EXERCISE:** Create an array of 3 matrices with 5 rows and 4 columns each containing data from an RNA expression experiment at different times. 
Rows are four treatments and columns are number of reads for different genes, and the third dimension is time.

```{r eval=TRUE}
my.exp1 <- my.exp
my.exp2 <- matrix(sample(1:1000, 20), nrow=5, ncol=4)
my.exp3 <- matrix(sample(1:1000, 20), nrow=5, ncol=4)

my.array <- array(c(my.exp1,my.exp2,my.exp3), dim=c(5,4,3))
dimnames(my.array) <- list(paste("Treatment",1:5), paste("Gene",1:4), paste("Time",0:2))

my.array
str(my.array)
dimnames(my.array)
```

**apply()** also works for any of the margins of an array:
```{r eval=TRUE}
apply(my.array, 2, mean)
apply(my.array, 3, mean)
apply(my.array, 1, mean)
```

We can also ask for a function to be applied on *TWO* margins of an array. In this case, the function returns a matrix, rather than a vector, of values.
```{r eval=TRUE}
apply(my.array, 1:2, mean)
```
